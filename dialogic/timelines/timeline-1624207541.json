			"text": "Day of Doubt\nThe stars are beautiful, but I can’t help but wonder when I last went to the bathroom.\nI can’t recall a single instance of defecation in all my time here.\nIn fact, I don’t remember ever taking this suit off.\nI don’t know how.\nWhere does the suit end and I begin?\nFor that matter, where do the moon carrots go?\nI “eat” them in the sense that after I collect them, I feel a sense of fullness, but I do not put them into my mouth.\nDo I even have one?\nHow would I know?\nI can’t take this damn helmet off.\nAs the moon bunny continues to expand and consume more and more moon carrots, I can’t help but wonder where they go as well.\nThere are no artificial hills on the moon courtesy of the moon bunny, and I have yet to see it since I sent it out the airlock.\nPerhaps the extraordinary growth of the creature can be attributed to the mass of the moon carrots.\nIf they are not broken down inside the body, are they still there rolling around inside the moon bunny’s cavernous stomach?\nIs the moon bunny simply a mass of veg with fluffy cheeks?\nI had best be careful around its mouth."
